# UserCF-and-ItemCF-Experiment

>In November, 2016, I became a teaching assistant for Big Data Analysis Foundation in SYSU. The first work I did is to design an experiment about Recommendation System. Finally, I came up with an experiment about Item Collaborating Filtering and User Collaborating Filtering, which are elementary in recommendation algorithm. Here is the code I used in experiment.
